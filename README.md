# Settlement Managment Game

The game starts off in the middle of a strange planet inhabited by fire-resistance fire ants. A small group of dragon settlers are stranded on this planet and need to repair their fallen space ship in order to return home. The repair will not be an easy a temperary settlement will need to be created to house the refugees while they work on reparing the ship.

The road will be long and hard, in order to survie the trials up ahead the remaing members of the ship will need to begin constructing a settlement. There are many actions that can be taken to building a settlement and as the manager of the settlement these actions are present persistently in the control menu

If at any point you are unsure about what an action does, make sure to read its tool tip! One of the most important action that can be down is digging. in order to dig select the dig action (d). Then click on an area you would like to dig, this will create a selection box allowing you to select multiple tiles at a time.

Once a selection has been made the blocks will notify the actors of their new action. The actors will proceed to fufill their action

Digging is not the only action that can be performed, buildings can be created in much the same way, Actors will begin a multistep process of construction rooms, first by digging out the area, the placing walls and furniture.

Once the building is complete actors will begin using it to fufill their needs, there are three major needs that need to met, health, hunger, and sleep. Health can be fixed through the infirmiry, hunger through the farmroom, and sleep from bedrooms.

Diging along with other actions is important for collecting valuable resources as well as revealing more of the map, some intial parts of the map are visible but the rest will need to be explored. There are rich metals underground that can be found, and good resources like the farmable wheat and strong wood to be found above ground. The most valuable of resources are the Space Ship parts needed to repair the ship.

These blocks need to be collected and returned to the ship in order to win the game. However these blocks have been collected by the Fire Ants that inhabit the planet.

The ants are not always hostile, they will intially be relatively peacefull, however entering their hills will surely change that attitude. On higher difficulties the ants will git annoyed with the dragons presence and begin to attack the settlement.
